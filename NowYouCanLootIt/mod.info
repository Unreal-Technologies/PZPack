description=Main goal of this mod is quality of life feature - you no longer need to craft bricks unrest you have pallets with bricks on the map. Modification gains you ability to take 15 clay bricks from a pallete, then pallete becomes empty. Also you can get 10 hay from hay on the ground, 50 hay from haystack and 100 hay from double haystack. So you can avoid to mow the grass for a long time.
