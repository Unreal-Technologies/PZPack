Fallas Lake <LINE> <LINE>
 A quaint town in the Doe Valley. <LINE> <LINE>
 Fallas Lake is a small town located far away from other locales. It is equidistant between Riverside to the North and Rosewood to the South.
 Along the main road, visitors and locals alike can enjoy a number of shops and eateries.
 Grab a few drinks at the bar or spend some time at the local bookstore.
 Due to Fallas Lake's rural location, Farming & Rural Supply and E.P. Tools are excellent shopping spots for all your indoor and outdoor needs.
 For the more spiritually minded, the Church is a located near our beautiful lake and community center.
 Fallas Lake may be quiet, but we hope you'll find that it's far from sleepy!
