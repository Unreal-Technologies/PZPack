Valley Station <LINE> <LINE>
 A growing community on the outskirts of Louisville <LINE> <LINE>
 Valley Station is a small community many people pass through on their commute to Louisville. Recently, that's begun to change.
 While it remains mostly rural, new homes are being constructed on the East side of town, near the wonderful Crossroads Mall.
 The Crossroads Mall and Shopping Center offers many goods and services to residents and visitors. There's something for everyone!
 Looking for outdoor entertainment? The Knox Creek Hunting Lodge and Shooting Range are right up your alley!
 Looking for a rush of adrenaline? Check out the drag racing strip on the West side of town.
 Valley Station is well on its way from a humble suburb to a vibrant city in its own right, and we hope you'll help us get there!
