description=Mod that adds over 100 various firearms available in 1993 America, replacing the vanilla firearms, along with related items and ammunition. Guns are rebalanced for their range, damage, and sound radius based on caliber and barrel length. Rifles and carbines should be more usable at lower levels, though you will still not be very good with low Aim skill as normal in Zomboid. Also adds the ability to use .38 special in .357 magnum chambered guns, slugs in shotguns, and bayonets on a number of guns.
